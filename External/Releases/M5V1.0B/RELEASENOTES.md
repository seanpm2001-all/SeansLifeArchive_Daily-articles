# Milestone 5 version 1.0B - October 19th 2020

## M5V1.0B

### About

This is the second public release of the Daily articles folder for the SeanPM Life Archive project. This release contains the directory structure of January 1st 2000 to March 31st 2021. I do not intend on releasing all the articles until a much later date, for privacy, security, and readiness reasons. I have released some documents, mostly just the templates. It took me a little while to build up the structure.

Some documents also can't be uploaded at the moment due to the GitHub 25 megabyte upload limit. The whole structure is here, but over 99.02% of the documents aren't. The current planned full release date is May 15th, 2040, or 1 week after I die (if it comes before this)

This release includes:

> * The structure from January 1st 2000 to March 31st 2021

> * A Project Wiki

> * Basic documentation

> * A main project `README.md` file

> * No other content included in this release

Changes in this release:

> * Added release data for the first release

> * Deleted 70 `IGNORE.md` files

> * No other changes in this release
